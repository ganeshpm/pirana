  Description:

    Sumo is short for SUmmarize Output. And it does exactly that. It
    gathers some useful information from NONMEM output files and prints
    a summary to screen.

  Examples:
    
    Get summary from an output file:

    $ sumo output.lst

    The above command may produce output similar to this:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    The first section of the output from sumo contains run
    diagnostics. They are largely self-explanatory but some of them
    depends on cut-off values. For example, the diagnostics for a
    large condition number compares the obtained condition number to a
    cut-off value (default is 1000). The default values for the
    cut-off values are defined in psn.conf. If a different value for a
    particular cut-off value is desired, it is possible to specify it
    as an option to sumo (see below).

    Next are the NONMEM minimization messages and $COV messages,
    including etabars etc. Following this is the objective function
    value. If $COV has been requested with the PRINT=E option (so that
    NONMEM reports eigenvalues) the condition number is also reported
    (the ratio between the largest and smallest eigenvalue)

    The column THETA contains the theta estimates as reported in the
    NONMEM output file and the numbers in parentheses after the theta
    estimates, are the relative standard errors (SE/Est). The square
    roots of the estimates of the diagonal elements of the OMEGA and
    SIGMA matrices in the NONMEM output file are reported in the OMEGA
    and SIGMA columns (except when -ci is used, see below) with the
    labels OM1, OM2 etc and SI1 SI2 etc. The off-diagonal estimates
    are reported as the corresponding correlations,
    i.e. sqrt(cov(om1,om2)/(var(om1)*var(om2))) with a label like
    OM3_2 (correlation between omega 3 and 2). The numbers in
    parentheses after the OMEGA and SIGMA columns are the relative SEs
    of the *variance* and *covariance* estimates, as taken from the
    NONMEM output file (but see option -ci and -sd_rse below).

    Relative standard errors are not displayed unless NONMEM reports
    the standard errors in the output file, i.e. when the covariance
    step has been requested and has terminated successfully.

  Options:

    The following options are valid:

    -h | -?

    Print a list of options.

    
    -help

    Print this, longer, help message.


        -debug='integer'

    Default value is: 0

    This is mainly for developers who wish to debug PsN. By default
    'integer' is zero but you can try setting it to '1' and you might
    get some helpful warnings. If you run in to problems that require
    support, you might be told to crank this number up and send the
    output to us.


    -debug_package='string'

    Default value is: empty string

    If use together with '-debug' it is possible to choose which part
    of PsN you want to see debug messages from. Again this is mostly
    for developers.


    -debug_subroutine='string'
    
    Default value is: empty string

    With this option it is possible to specify, with even finer
    granularity, which part of PsN you want to see debug messages
    from. This is definitely only for developers.


    -csv

    Produce output in which the columns of the parameters estimates
    and standard errors are comma separated. This option can be used
    if you wish to import the sumo output into a spreadsheet programs,
    such as MS Excel. (Something like this is probably what you would
    want to do in that case: sumo -csv run1.lst > sumooutput.csv)


    -precision='integer'

    The default value is 4.

    Specified the number of significant digits for the parts of the
    sumo output that are computed by PsN, i.e. relative standard
    errors, confidence intervals and the condition number. Output that
    is just taken from the NONMEM list file, e.g. thetas and OFV, are
    unaffected.


    -c_level='integer'

    Default value is 95.

    This option specifies the coverage of the confidence interval
    computed by the -ci option (see below). Allowed values are 90, 95,
    99 and 99.5


    -confidence_interval
    -ci

    This option computes and reports the traditional confidence
    intervals for the parameter estimates instead of the relative
    standard errors: CI = estimate +/- c_level*SE.

    With this option the parameter estimates reported in the OMEGA and
    SIGMA columns are the numbers given in the NONMEM output file,
    i.e. no transformation to CVs or correlations is performed.

    
    -sd_rse

    The default is to report the relative standard errors for the
    random effects parameters (omega and sigma) on the variance scale
    (SE/variance estimate). Specifying this option will report these
    on the (approximate) standard deviation scale: (SE/variance
    estimate)/2.


    -max_problem_number='integer'
    -max_subproblem_num='integer'

    Default values are 1.

    PsN divides NONMEM output into problems and sub-problem. 

    In the most common case when there are only one $PROBLEM in the
    NMtran control stream there is only one problem in the NONMEM
    output. Should more than one $PROBLEM statement be used there will
    be the same number of problems in the output.

    Each problem contains at least one sub-problem. Should $SIMULATION
    be used there will be as many sub-problems as the value of NSUBS.

    The default is for sumo to report the results for the first
    sub-problem for the first problem only.

    
    -no_check_run=''

    This option, when set to a value different from the empty string,
    will suppress the initial run diagnostic output of sumo.

    -correlation_limit='number'

    The cut-off for issuing a warning for high correlations between
    the parameter estimates. This test will only be made if the $COV
    step has been requested in the NMtran control stream. The default
    is 0.9 and is set in psn.conf.


    -condition_number_limit='number'

    The cut-off for issuing a warning for a high condition number. The
    test will only be made if the $COV step has been requested in the
    NMtran control stream and NONMEM has been asked to report
    eigenvalues ($COV PRINT=E). The default is 1000 and is set in psn.conf.


    -near_bound_sign_digits='integer'

    When a parameter estimates is equal to a boundary with these many
    significant digits, a warning will be issued. The default is for
    NONMEM VI to report if parameter estimates are close to a boundary
    value but this can be turned off. The boundary test in sumo is
    independent of the way NONMEM is configured and will report these
    types of issues in output from NONMEM VI. The default is 2 and is
    set in psn.conf.


    -near_zero_boundary_limit='number'

    If the bound is 0, the boundary test will issue a warning if the
    estimate this close to zero.  The default value is 0.001 and is
    set in psn.conf.

    -sign_digits_off_diagonals='integer' 

    The boundary test for off-diagonal omega elements are performed by
    first converting the covariances to the corresponding correlations
    and then check if they are close to +/-1 with this many
    significant digits.  The default value is 0.001 and is set in
    psn.conf.


    -large_theta_cv_limit='number'
    -large_omega_cv_limit='number'
    -large_sigma_cv_limit='number'

    When the CV (SE/estimate) for a parameter estimates is greater
    than this a warning will be issued. The default values are 0.3,
    0.5 and 0.3 for thetas, omegas and sigmas respectively, and are
    set in psn.conf.
