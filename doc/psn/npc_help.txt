    Numerical Predictive Check.






    Options:

      The options are given here in their long form. Any option may be
      abbreviated to any nonconflicting prefix. The -threads option
      may be abbreviated to -t(or even -thr) but -debug may not be
      abbreviated to -d because it conflicts with -debug_packages and
      -debug_subroutines.

      The following options are valid:

      -dv=VARIABLE

      Name of dependent variable. Default is DV.
      Case sensitive, must be exactly the same case and spelling as in modelfile.
      Maximum of 4 letters because of NONMEM limitation, unless either IPRED or IWRES.

      -keep_estimation
      
      Perform post-hoc evalutaion step for each simulated dataset,
      i.e. keep the $ESTIMATION record and set MAXEVALS to 0. In this case
      variables such as IPRED(F) are based on the re-estimated post-hoc 
      parameters.      

      -lst_file=file

      The npc will update initial parameter estimates in the model to
      the final values in the lst-file. Optional parameter.
      Cannot be used together with -msfo_file option nor with a model
      containing a $NONPARAMETRIC record.

      -msfo_file=file

      The npc will use the NONMEM state defined in the update file.
      Cannot be used together with -lst_file option.
      If the modelfile contains a $NONPARAMETRIC record this parameter
      is required, otherwise it is optional.

      -n_simulation_models=N

      Default 1, which means all simulations are run in the same modelfile.
      By setting this option to a number N greater than 1, the 'samples' simulations
      will be split equally between N model files, which can be run in parallel.
      This option cannot be used together with option -sim_table or, if 
      the NONMEM version < 7, together with -dv=CWRES.

      -no_of_strata=number

      Only allowed together with -stratify_on.
      An integer requesting the number of strata.
      The number must be equal to or less than the number of unique 
      values in the stratification column.
      If the number is smaller than the number of unique values, the 
      observations will be grouped so that the number of observations in
      each group/strata is approximately equal.

      -noprediction
      
      Add NOPREDICTION to the $SIMULATION record of the simulation model
      in addition to ONLYSIMULATION. This option is generally recommended
      with likelihood models for odd type data.

      -orig_table=file

      Use an already created tablefile with original data,
      instead of letting the program create it.
      This option can only be used together with -sim_table.
      A modelfile must still be given as program argument, but it will not be run.

      -samples=number

      Number of simulated datasets to generate, required.
      Must be at least 20.

      -sim_table=file

      Use an already created tablefile with simulated data,
      instead of letting the program run the simulations.
      This option can only be used together with -orig_table.
      A modelfile must still be given as program argument, but it will not be run.

      -stratify_on=COLUMN_HEADER

      Header of column to stratify on.
      The npc will stratify the data on unique values in the specified
      column, and perform separate analyses on each set. Stratification 
      may also be done on a user-defined parameter which must be called STRT.
