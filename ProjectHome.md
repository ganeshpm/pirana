Pira√±a is a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing PK-PD analyses with NONMEM. It provides a platform for model management, editing, running and evaluation. It can be used for modeling on your local PC, but also supports an easy-to-implement distribution infrastructure (PCluster), and supports the Sun Grid Engine and Mosix-clusters.

It is under development at the department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology at the Slotervaart Hospital and the Netherlands Cancer Institute.
